Its answer varies depending on cultural, individual, philosophical, and religious beliefs. Here are some of the perspectives people might offer:\\n\\n1. Religious Perspectives: Many religions offer their own answers to the meaning of life. For example, in many strands of Christianity, the meaning of life is to follow the will and teachings of God, leading to eternal salvation. In Buddhism, it may be to achieve enlightenment and end the cycle of suffering and rebirth.\\n\\n2. Philosophical Perspectives: Philosophers have proposed various interpretations. Existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre suggest that life inherently has no meaning, and it is up to individuals to create their own meaning. In contrast, philosophers such as Aristotle believed that the purpose of life is to achieve eudaimonia, often translated as happiness or human flourishing.\\n\\n3. Scientific Perspectives: From a biological standpoint, the purpose of life can be seen as survival and the perpetuation of species through reproduction, driven by the process of evolution by natural selection.\\n\\n4. Humanistic Perspectives: Humanism, a rational philosophy devoid of supernatural belief, sees the meaning of life as the quest for personal growth, the development of humanity, and the pursuit of knowledge and happiness.\\n\\n5. Individual Perspectives: Many assert that the meaning of life is a personal quest and that it can be found in individual passions, relationships, achievements, the pursuit of knowledge, the creation of art, or the journey of self-discovery and personal improvement.\\n\\n6. Nihilistic Perspectives: Nihilism suggests that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Nihilists often contend that life has no purpose other than what we create for ourselves.\\n\\n7. Absurdist Perspectives: Absurdist philosophy, as described by Albert Camus, posits that humans seek meaning in a chaotic, indifferent universe where such meaning cannot be found. The absurd arises out of this conflict, and individuals must navigate their existence in spite of it.\\n\\nUltimately, the meaning of life is a subjective inquiry – one that each person must explore and answer in their own way. It is a question that can lead to a variety of answers, each reflecting different aspects of human thought and experience.'"]},"execution_count":24,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["get_response(\"What is the meaning of life?\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-12T05:41:39.901453Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-12T05:41:39.900344Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-12T05:41:40.087584Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-12T05:41:40.086439Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-12T05:41:39.901416Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","df = pd.read_csv('../kaggle_dataset/archive/lb_related_5k.csv')\n","df = df[:3]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-12T05:41:40.091476Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-12T05:41:40.090731Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-12T05:41:40.107674Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-12T05:41:40.106582Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-12T05:41:40.091433Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>rewrite_prompt</th>\n","      <th>original_text</th>\n","      <th>rewritten_text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Use more descriptive language to enhance the a...</td>\n","      <td>The relationship between sustainability and to...</td>\n","      <td>Sure, here is a more descriptive version of th...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Use more descriptive language to enhance the a...</td>\n","      <td>This study tested the effect of voter's politi...</td>\n","      <td>Sure, here is a version of the text with more ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Use more descriptive language to enhance the a...</td>\n","      <td>While onsite measurement of air permeability p...</td>\n","      <td>Sure, here is the text with more descriptive l...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                                      rewrite_prompt  \\\n","0  Use more descriptive language to enhance the a...   \n","1  Use more descriptive language to enhance the a...   \n","2  Use more descriptive language to enhance the a...   \n","\n","                                       original_text  \\\n","0  The relationship between sustainability and to...   \n","1  This study tested the effect of voter's politi...   \n","2  While onsite measurement of air permeability p...   \n","\n","                                      rewritten_text  \n","0  Sure, here is a more descriptive version of th...  \n","1  Sure, here is a version of the text with more ...  \n","2  Sure, here is the text with more descriptive l...

mentioning the \"aroma of fresh bread and pastries,\" \"the scent of the Parisian streets,\" \"cool shadows across the cobblestone streets,\" and \"the scent of the Seine River.\" These are atmospheric touches that aim to transport the reader to France, offering a sensory experience and setting the scene.\\n\\n2. **Cultural References**: The inclusion of elements that are personally identifiable with France (e.g., fresh bread and pastries, cobblestone streets, Seine River) is a clear attempt to strengthen the connection of the text with its French setting. This suggests that the prompt directed the LLM to not only enhance the atmosphere but also to be culturally specific.\\n\\n3. **Emotional Atmosphere**: The original text is academic and straightforward in presenting the study\\'s findings, whereas the rewritten text adds an \"anticipation and excitement\" about the French Presidential Election, indicating a prompt towards adding an emotional layer to the text.\\n\\n4. **Direct Comparison of Changes**: Analyzing the parts of the text that remain mostly unchanged (e.g., the structure of the study, the findings), it\\'s clear that the prompt didn\\'t ask for a change in content or structure but rather an enhancement in language and setting.\\n\\n5. **Descriptive Political Landscape**: The second paragraph in the rewritten text does not introduce sensorial language but rather maintains a focus on clarity while still using slightly more evocative language (\"examined\" vs \"tested\", \"stark contrast\" vs \"showed that\", \"compelling evidence\" vs \"support\") to describe the political orientations and their influence. This suggests that the descriptive enhancement was more focused on setting rather than on the entirety of the content.\\n\\n6. **Absence of Technical Alteration**: Although the wording is more descriptive, there is no change in the technical terms related to the study or its findings, indicating that the prompt emphasized atmosphere rather than technical clarity or simplification.\\n\\nFrom the differences between the original and rewritten texts, it is reasonable to infer that the prompt guided the LLM to add descriptive, sensory, and emotional language to the text, thereby enhancing the atmospheric setting while leaving the core content and findings intact.',\n","       '**Inferred Prompt**: Enhance the text with more descriptive adjectives and adverbs to create a richer atmosphere.\\n\\n**Chain of Thoughts**:\\n- The rewritten text includes additional adjectives such as \"valuable,\" \"meticulous,\" \"distinct,\" \"compelling,\" and \"significant\" which are intended to add depth and detail to the description, thus creating a richer atmosphere.\\n- Adverbs like \"meticulously\" are used multiple times to emphasize the care and precision with which the investigation and analysis were conducted.\\n- The phrase \"valuable tool\" in the rewritten text replaces \"useful approach,\" giving a stronger connotation to the importance of the air permeability measurement.\\n- The word \"combined\" is replaced with \"combined utilization,\" which is more formal and gives a sense of thoroughness.\\n- The term \"offers\" is used instead of \"provides,\" which can suggest a more active role in giving something beneficial.\\n- The phrase \"meticulously designed\" implies a more careful and deliberate process of design compared to the simpler \"was developed.\"\\n- The use of \"yielded compelling data\" in the rewritten text suggests that the results were not only obtained but were also particularly interesting or persuasive, which is not explicitly stated in the original text.\\n- The word \"discovered\" is introduced in the rewritten text, suggesting a sense of revelation or uncovering of knowledge, which enhances the atmosphere of scientific discovery.\\n- The phrase \"can be achieved\" replaced \"is possible,\" which adds a sense of accomplishment.\\n- Overall, the changes are consistent with an attempt to make the text more descriptive and vivid, focusing on enhancing the atmosphere by providing more detail and emphasizing the thoroughness and importance of the research process and findings.'],\n","
